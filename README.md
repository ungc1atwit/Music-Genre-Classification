# Music-Genre-Classification
## Introduction
Music genres facilitate the identification of patterns and makes it easier to find music that is most satisfying to our personal taste by exploring more of their favorite music types. Music genres also help companies make recommendations and suggestions that would considerably enhance their customers’ listening enjoyment. Genre helps on organize a large mass of music so that it’s easier to locate and identify a song we don’t know. In this project, we developed a Music Genre Classification using Machine Learning techniques. We first created our dataset but extracting music features from 1000 song using LIBROSA library. Then we used some Classification techniques such as K-nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Logistic Regression.

## Datasets and Features 
We used GTZAN dataset, which provided us 1000 of 30 seconds music clips, a 100-music clip for each genre and each music clip was labeled with its own genre. 
After that we applied Python library, LIBROSA, to visualize and extract features from the music clips and create our own dataset. For visualization, LIBROSA provides Spectrogram which is a visual representation of the spectrum of frequencies of sound or other signals as they vary with time. 
Below are examples of two audios from two different genres.
